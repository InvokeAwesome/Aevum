##Name 
Haven't settled on a name yet. The character is vaguely derived from a "Jason" from the original story so I'll go with that for now.

#Place in life at outset:
He is one of 120 Old-Testament-style “Judges” in the same civilization as Zack and Eve.

He is 823 years old

He is the oldest and most revered of the Judges. The miraculous signs he has performed are some of the most famous to date, and many of his written works are considered scripture by some theological schools. (As in our world, canonization is a slow process and settles over time).

## History and character development
Jason has only officially held the office for about 200 years, but ever since his adolescence (50s) he has been considered a prophet.

The early days of his spiritual journey were marked by a vow of celibacy and intense asceticism. There are many monastic orders, but he was called to a more solitary existence. For most of the year, he would survive alone in the wilderness, praying and fasting and writing down his visions and insights. Once every new moon he would come to the capital city and preach, also sharing his written works (some of which were epistles, some poetry, and nearly all of them copied and published right away.)  

People often tried to follow him back into the wilderness, but he was always spirited away and could never be found. Still, he had many imitators and rivals.

It took a long time before he was appointed to be a Judge. (Too long, according to his fans and devotees). He never sought the office, and actually took it grudgingly at first, but soon came to find joy in his new form of ministry. 

Judges here are a more developed and established version of our Old Testament Judges, with a more formally defined office that centers around mediating between the city states. The office of Judge also somewhat resembles that of the Roman censor, insofar as they have the right to expel government officials for immoral behavior. They also have veto powers over local legislation if it is deemed to be morally compromised.

It should be noted that the aforementioned roles and powers are highly regionalized, and not consistent across the realm. The above pattern is common, but their authority derives entirely from historical contingencies and legal precedents. The culture is diverse from region to region, and the customs surrounding the Judges vary. That said, any Judge is automatically given deferential treatment in any region, and their office is universally honored at least in form if not in substance. For example, if a Judge was travelling to another jurisdiction and pronounced a judgement that would be accepted without question in his own jurisdiction, the local officials would at least formally accept his decision, even if they don't intend to actually implement it. They would probably later oficially excuse themselves based on "unforeseen circumstances" or otherwise write up an elaborate loophole.

The 120 Judges are on paper considered to have the highest official administrative power, but it would be an overstatement to say that they “rule” their regions. The real power his held by various local magistrates and oligarchs, along with wealthy family-syndicates. The Judges realistically only hold sway insofar as the public’s admiration of them allows. 

They are theocratically appointed, using ritualistic processes of divination that vary per region. Their appointment is usually heavily influenced by the priesthood, and must be confirmed  by the chief pontiff. (Although if a pontiff rejects a candidate for any remotely questionable reason, it has historically been seen as an overstepping of his customary bounds and is tolerated only grumblingly by the people.) As in Jason’s case, they often double as prophets, some of whom are on par with prophets like our Elijah (along with the commensurate miraculous signs). 

The Judges have been generally well-esteemed until about a year ago, when public opinion began to shift in favor of a unified monarchy (with Zack and Eve as the intended King and Queen.) There has always been ambiguity in the authority structure of the Judges, but recently there have also been suspicions of some Judges being falsely appointed, having allegedly paid off certain key clergy to gain the office.
