<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above characters are hiking together along the side of a river, heading down the mountain. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They take a break, because the boy is tired. He sits on some wet moss and gets his tush dampened. His older sister sees and makes fun of them, which starts an argument.  <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mother meanwhile hangs up a gravity water filter and diffuses the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mother [in Korean]</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Kids, come put your hand in this river! It feels amazing."</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They do so, and it&#8217;s surprisingly cold, like ice water. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They watch the filter process some water into their empty thermos jugs.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They all take deep draughts. It&#8217;s the most refreshing, delicious water they&#8217;ve ever tasted. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The young girl sits there for a while and watches the water flow over and around some rocks. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up ahead, the stream splits into two different directions as it heads down the mountain. She watches with particular interest the point at which the stream bifurcates against a large, mossy boulder.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After their break is done, they follow the left-hand branch of the river further down. They can start to hear the rushing of a waterfall.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With increasing giddiness, the children start to pick up their pace. Their mother watches them contentedly. The roar of the waterfall gets louder.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally they see it: although the waterfall is by no means impressive compared to some of the others in these mountains, it is the largest the children have ever seen personally. They both squeal with delight, and describe everything they see in great detail to their mother who is also standing right there and looking at it.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She smiles at them and nods enthusiastically.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mother [in Korean]</dt>
<dd>
<p>"See what we&#8217;ve been missing? Aren&#8217;t you glad Dad finally let us come out here?"</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Children [in English]</dt>
<dd>
<p>"YEAH!!"</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mother [in Korean]</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Maybe we can convince him to come with us next time. What do you think?"</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Younger Brother [alternating Korean and English]</dt>
<dd>
<p>Proceeds to optimistically describe the particular way in which their Dad would agree to do so.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The girl is more pensive, but is clearly imagining the scenario with glee. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They proceed downstream.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They want to cross the river at the base of the falls, where it&#8217;s thinner.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before they can do that, however, there is a steep, 15-foot drop next to the waterfall that they must descend. There&#8217;s no better point to descend nearby.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mother takes off her pack and heads down first. She lowers herself down to a narrow ledge about 4 feet down. Then, facing the slope, she picks her way back and forth along a path of sorts, which proves to be easily navigable with some patience. She reaches the bottom in less than 15 seconds<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She has the children lower down all of the packs to her.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She then invites the children to come down.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They were at first captivated by their cool mom and her feat of dexterity, but now that they realize that they too must make the descent, they are suddenly gripped by fear.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Children [in Korean]</dt>
<dd>
<p>They complain, protesting the danger.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their small voices are almost drowned out by the sound of the waterfall, and they must shout to be heard.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mother surveys the descent again, pointing out the steps they must take. Raising her voice, she encourages them:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mother [in Korean]</dt>
<dd>
<p>"I&#8217;m right here, guys! Even if you did fall, I&#8217;d catch you. But you won&#8217;t fall, because you&#8217;re really strong! Grace, you can go first, to show your younger brother how it&#8217;s done."<br></p>

<p>It was all childish bullshit. I was a cringey, deluded idiot. There are no fantasy worlds, no magical heroes who will fall in love with me. It&#8217;s pure escapism, meant to distract us from the bleakness of the real world for a few happy minutes, or hours. I bought in to it so deeply entirely because I wasn&#8217;t happy with my life. How the hell did it take me until 11th grade to finally accept this?</p>

<p>Satan (apparent): It seems like Satan is trying to frighten Grace away from Grace&#8217;s mission. The spiritual attack comes the night before the B-Team show up. He apparently wants her to be tired and oppressed during those first crucial days, so that she misses her chance to find them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Satan (actual): Grace has many more spiritual and physical trials awaiting her. Satan wants her to feel like she&#8217;s overcoming them against all odds. He wants her to feel like the heroine she always wanted to be. She will <em>still</em> go after the B-Team despite her extreme fatigue and anxiety, because she is the determined heroine. She will quickly forget that it was only through the interposition of Christ that the demon was driven away.</p>

<p>God: Christ&#8217;s brief words sum up exactly what God is doing here. He does indeed want her to overcome her fears, but through trust rather than self-reliance.

<h3 id="_style_6">Style</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Most of?) the book will be written in iambic pentameter couplets, also known as "heroic couplets." This takes after the style of Alexander Pope (translating Homer) and John Dryden (translating Virgil). My goal is to resurrect classical epic poetry for our current cultural milieu, in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and accessible enough for the mainstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not just a gimmick, I hope, but serves a more immediate purpose for the narrative. The portions in verse are written from a heavenly, angelic perspective (see below), and the poetic format is intended to evoke that transcendence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I should be able to achieve an earthly counterpoint to this by dropping into prose when the perspective shifts to that of a mortal human. Hopefully this will be evocative enough to reinforce the other narrative goals of the text.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_perspective">Perspective</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The portions of the book that are written in verse, are from perspective of Grace&#8217;s guardian angel. We get a very intimate third-person view of Grace, with impossible levels of detail. The angel can see things as minute as Grace&#8217;s heart rate, body temperature, and the subtlest body language. We also sometimes have "educated guessing" about what she&#8217;s thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think it may be important to make sure that we don&#8217;t ever use definitive statements about what she&#8217;s thinking, though. I don&#8217;t think we want an unreliable narrator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this story was going to be told in game format, I had the player thinking that they were actually playing as Grace, but then turn the tables when it&#8217;s revealed that the player is actually her angel that has been guiding her. The twist is meaningful because the angel doesn&#8217;t even realize it is a separate entity until that point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In book format, though, I think we should still use third-person pronouns for Grace. Doing otherwise might seem <strong>too</strong> jarring, and make the narrator unreliable.</p>

<h4 id="_past_obsession_with_isekai">Past Obsession with Isekai</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This went beyond merely enjoying the show and the genre broadly. She actually held on to a deep-seated belief that she would one day be swept off into another world, where she could live the fantasy that she was yearning for. Grace mentally rehearses all of the preparations she made, ranging from always carrying survival supplies to studying how to communicate with people who don&#8217;t share a language with you. She tried her hand at things like marksmanship, martial arts, and even swordplay, but didn&#8217;t have the discipline to keep up with them for long. (She still tells herself that she&#8217;s just on hiatus from her martial arts, though.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took her until just recently to finally discard those notions and accept “real life.”</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_motivations_for_studying_medicine">Motivations for studying medicine</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>She is a hypochondriac and is deathly afraid of something being wrong with her body. It became exhausting and expensive to go see medical professionals constantly, so she decided to learn how to diagnose and treat herself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She figures that being a doctor is the best way to realistically play out her savior fantasies. She actually can learn how to save people’s lives, after all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also historical reasons for both her hypochondria and her savior-obsession:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When she was about 11, her mother, who was fairly adventurous, took their family hiking in some mountains. Her father, who was a cautious — or even nervous — person, was worried about the risks and didn’t want to go, but his wife insisted. Her younger brother ended up in a hiking accident and almost died, although fortunately her mother, who was an EMT, saved his life with some timely first-aid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, whenever her mother tried to make any ambitious plans for another adventure, her father would use the above incident as ammunition to shoot them down. They never really did any trips like it again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grace was influenced by this in that she admired her mother’s ability to save Yoon, but also saw how her father’s fears had been actually realized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her father and mother never separated or anything, and they do relate over a lot of things and statistically have a pretty good marriage. That said, the aforementioned hiking incident kind of killed off a good chunk of their relationship. Her mom feels tied down and not authorized to impart her adventurousness to her children. Her father lives in perpetual worry because of the way his wife takes risks, both professionally and whenever she gets the chance to sneak out on an unplanned adventure with her kids.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grace and her younger brother of course picked right up on this. For Grace, it made her want to build a better marriage, so she has very specific standards when it comes to men. She’s spent a lot of time thinking about that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She also has both adventurous and nervous tendencies. In any given situation, the side that wins out is dependent on how much time she has to think about the risks. (So she may jump into a risky situation on the spur of the moment, but if she&#8217;s had enough time to think about it, she probably won&#8217;t.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_personality">Personality</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She’s smart, and retains information pretty well, but she struggles with diligence, academically speaking. She really does have everything it takes to be a decent doctor, but her grades suffer because of procrastination. She hates this about herself&#8230;&#8203; but then she buys a shiny new indie game during a Steam sale and thinks, "Well, I&#8217;ll focus better after I beat this." (She&#8217;s also a completionist, so beating these games tends to take quite a while.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She has many ambitions and many hobbies, but is a lot better at starting projects than finishing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike either of her parents, who have been trapped in the lower-middle-class because of their spendthrift natures, she is actually rather prudent with her money. She is frugal almost to a fault, and has built up impressive savings for someone her age, despite paying for college largely on her own. This is how she was able to finance her eventual quest to find the "B-Team".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is obsessive, so when she’s a fan of something, she’s a <strong>big</strong> fan. She will spend an amazing amount of time researching about and investing in her fandoms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is sensitive and has a good sense of how other people feel, so she’s basically amiable and easy to like. However, she often struggles to care about or do anything out of her way to actually address the negative feelings she senses in other people.</p>

He should faintly resemble Eve, maybe in his hair or eye color. (They&#8217;re distantly related.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Floodless people his age usually look around their late 30s / early 40s to us and stay that way for a very long time, only showing increased signs of aging around the 650s.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_history_2">History</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He and Eve have known each other since childhood, due to their close kinship and the extreme regard for familial relationships in their culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because his parents were particularly well-positioned and well-respected in the upper echelons of the church, there was always a very good chance that he would become the chief pontiff someday. There had been several pontiffs among his direct ancestors, in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eve’s attention towards him could not go unnoticed. She had inserted herself so inexorably into his daily affairs for such a long time that the thought of life without her rarely crossed his mind. When it did, it was always unpleasant to him, because Eve had done a remarkable job of responding to his goals, habits, and preferences. He had neither need nor desire to look anywhere else for a partner and mate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, as it was becoming increasingly apparent n his early 50s that the office of chief pontiff would one day fall to him, he received pressure to remain celibate from his parents and other powerful members of his family. For a long time now, pontiffs had all maintained celibacy, to the point that it was now customary. His family didn’t want him to ruin his odds by marrying Eve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Zack is an idealist, and wrestles with himself a great deal when it comes to optimal long-term decision-making. Eve had made herself the absolute prime choice to be his bodyguard, and he was paranoid to a fault about his personal safety, so he wanted her to be with him all the time. (See Eve&#8217;s doc for how and why she did this.) This wouldn&#8217;t have been so hard if the "optimal candidate" had been a man, but it is completely taboo in their culture to cohabitate with the opposite sex, even in a professional capacity. (And, frankly, he was completely infatuated with her. How could he not be?)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He decided that he would remain celibate until he took the throne, and then select her as his bodyguard in a merely professional capacity. He was betting that public opinion would shift towards wanting him to just go ahead and marry her, as it would seem scandalous to have her around all the time and yet be unmarried.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(It should be noted that celibacy was not yet a canonical discipline in this church, but simply a very well-established custom. Long ago, priests would sometimes marry after their ordination, and there was even one historical example of a chief pontiff doing so. This was done only on an exceptional basis, and usually had to do with an urgent necessity to preserve a family&#8217;s patrilineage. Zack happened to also be in this situation, being the only son in his immediate family, which lent legitimacy to the move.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After 200 years, Zack was finally elevated to the office he desired. His plan to justify a marriage worked, and the damage to his reputation was only temporary. Even in the first few months of his reign, Eve’s constant presence had saved his life a few times in really spectacular ways, which would not have been possible unless they lived together. Since things were working out really well, the public got used to having a married pontiff again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every one of pontiffs in recent memory had been assassinated within a decade of taking office, but with Eve at the head of his retinue, even the most sophisticated, multi-pronged attacks to date were thwarted in style. The political stability afforded by the arrangement paid off in spades for their public esteem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They became so popular, in fact, that certain factions wanted to set them up as titular monarchs. Their civilization was mostly held together by an Old Testament-style system of theocratic Judges overlayed on a network of city-state alliances. This system was losing credibility in modern political discourse, and the tide had been growing for some time now in favor of a unified monarchy. (While the chief pontiff enjoyed a great deal of political influence, he did not have direct authority over the secular management of most territories in the realm.) The stability and charisma of Zack and Eve became the icon for this movement, and they had successfully worked themselves into the center of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though there isn’t a precedent for a unifying monarchy in their society, more distant kingdoms have tried it and have done well enough to provoke local envy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_personality_2">Personality</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zack is analytical, chatty, and a perfectionist. Like most perfectionists, he strives to correct any perceived fault in himself, and can&#8217;t understand why others would fail to do the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He constantly overthinks things, yet has a natural tendency to let his mouth move faster than his brain. However, he has tempered that flaw over his many years, and developed the habit of pausing intentionally for at least three seconds before saying anything other than an innocuous question. He forgets that habit when he’s tired or hungry or emotionally unstable, and can say hurtful, critical things before he has a chance to catch himself. He also regularly stops mid-sentence to re-phrase his thoughts more precisely, so talking to him can be tiresome for those used to a more natural flow of conversation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though he tries to be careful with his words, he is inquisitive to a fault. He&#8217;s usually the one driving conversations, mostly by asking a lot of overly-specific questions. This can make people uncomfortable, as he tends to "pry."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be noted that these flaws are mostly manifested in private conversation. In public addresses he&#8217;s an absolute rock star.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He inwardly has a high opinion of himself, and despite toning down his pride outwardly, he still harbors an inveterate superiority complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He used to be a pretty big jerk because of his pride and critical nature, but has become more likable after intentionally refining his personality for a long time. Eve has been an essential part of this transformation, as she honestly and bluntly points out his unlikable qualities. Far from driving him away, this behavior has increased his opinion of her to even greater heights.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, despite his carefully-groomed external charisma, nothing about him is charitable. Everything he does is ultimately for himself, and he often uses others to his own advantage. His preference is to find a “win-win,” but he doesn’t hesitate to step on people when such a solution can&#8217;t be found. His relationship with Eve is one such "win-win," but he has grown so accustomed to viewing her as an asset that he scarcely ever looks at her through the eyes of selfless love.</p>

<h4 id="_name_2">Name</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Hyav” comes from the semitic root ḥyw, from which the biblical Eve derives her name (“Havah” or “Hawwah”). It means “life,” i.e. "Mother of all the Living" for the biblical Eve.</p>

<h4 id="_overview_4">Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is the bodyguard of Tsadq (Zack), the chief pontiff of her people’s religion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is enjoys a high degree of popular favor due to her amazing super-soldier abilities, having successfully defended the pontiff from every assassination attempt to date. (This is an unprecedented feat. Almost every recent pontiff has either been assassinated or resigned out of fear of a plot. Eve is thus directly responsible for a marked improvement in the political stability of the realm.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is mute. No one knows exactly why, but her brain does show some physiological abnormalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is 295 years old (born on the same day as Zack)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is also married to Zack, the chief pontiff, who is also her third cousin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_appearance_4">Appearance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to her extreme enhancements and training, she is abnormally muscular. Some cybernetic implants are visible as bumps just under the skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She makes every effort to accentuate her physical strength through her dress and bearing. (This is typical behavior for warriors in their culture, although it is traditionally a masculine pursuit.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the stress of Zack’s recent climb towards monarchical power, she has spent less time training recently. Nevertheless, her genetic, cybernetic, and nanotech enhancements maintain much of her body’s strength and fitness. She wears her full battle suit constantly whenever leaving their fortress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though at her age she should look to be in her late 30s or early 40s, she has had countless medical anti-aging procedures. (These only became available recently). It has mostly worked, but there are still some lines she can’t quite erase without looking fake. (Imagine a pretty 25-year-old who has been smoking for a few years, and you&#8217;ll get the picture.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_history_3">History</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She and Zack have known each other since childhood, due to their close kinship and the extreme regard for familial relationships in their culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She was still in her minority when she realized how great Zack’s potential for success was. Despite not being terribly analytical, she had a strong sense of intuition that told her that, if she could make herself an essential part of his life, she would benefit herself greatly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So even as a child, she made sure she spent as much time playing with him as possible, and paid very close attention to his likes and dislikes. She endeavored to adapt herself to become exactly what he wanted and needed: mentally and physically; socially and pragmatically. Because of his idealism and "optimize everything" approach to life, she knew that if she could simply make herself the most "optimal" choice for his wife, then her victory would be assured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being mute, she was an excellent listener, and Zack always loved to ramble to her about whatever he was learning or improving about himself. To him, her constant, persistent, intentional, and undivided attention was soothing, and addictive. Speaking to her has always been as natural and vital to him as breathing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her ability to communicate improved along with technology, and she always mastered the current cutting-edge text-to-speech software. By the time our story starts, she can “speak” with an almost-natural-sounding computer voice by flitting her fingers as input, as though typing on an invisible keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As pontiffs started getting assassinated one after another, she could see Zack&#8217;s paranoia kick into full gear as he strove towards becoming a candidate. Much of his time was spent researching self-defense methods and the latest technology, so naturally she decided to make herself the best possible defense for him. She underwent experimental super-soldier enhancements and training, integrating every means of increasing her strength that was available to her (no matter how dangerous or unproven or illegal.) Miraculously, almost every enhancement succeeded brilliantly, and she eventually became regarded as the strongest and deadliest single individual on the planet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her efforts paid off (see Zack’s doc).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After Zack took office, her public popularity and influence in his cabinet skyrocketed with every thwarted assassination attempt. She became a pop-culture icon with an avid fan following. Because she essentially resurrected the long-defunct, traditional vestments that wives of clergy used to wear during formal ceremonies, top clothing brands picked up on the style for streetwear. It&#8217;s pretty trendy now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The high-profile nature of her successful enhancements also catalyzed the deregulation and advancement of transhuman enhancements globally. The assassination attempts had died out for a while, but began to increase again as more people gained access to the same technologies she had. But between unlimited funding, a team of the country’s best people, superior intel, her ever-sharpening experience, and a genius for combat that flowed from her instinctive nature, no one could best her. Zack was all too pleased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She prioritized her capacity as a bodyguard over her capacity to be a mother. Pontiffs have traditionally been celibate, and Zack broke sharply with tradition by taking a wife. (See his doc for why he did this.) Pontiffs were not expected to have children and were canonically forbidden from appointing heirs to their position. Thus, childbearing was far from desirable for Eve, because it would not only take her out of commission, but cause their marriage&#8217;s tenuous political legitimacy to come under fire again. Despite the cultural and dogmatic taboo on the procedure, she had herself secretly sterilized. Publicly they said that they were simply not successful at having children, and she was assumed to be naturally barren.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_personality_3">Personality</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is acutely empathetic and circumspect. She has spent far more time listening than expressing (because of her muteness), but this is only one cause of this trait. She is also more outwardly-focused by nature, and has little in the way of personality traits that are distinctively her own. Her personality is mostly made to match what she perceives others (chiefly, Zack) want from her.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there are some insuppressible quirks that are definitively hers:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her sense of humor is subtle, but mischievous. This is the only way in which she actively and intentionally flusters other people, rather than trying to please them. She hasn’t been able to talk until recently (and even now, talks only rarely), so this usually manifests in either practical jokes or ornery body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She can usually guess when those actions will ultimately improve or damage her relationships, so she uses them judiciously (not at the expense of endearing herself in the long run).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she misjudges and plays a prank that only serves to be aggravating (or behaves impishly when sobriety is called for), she gets sulky. She rarely apologizes until roughly 6 hours have elapsed. Her apologies are always handwritten, anonymous, and delivered covertly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, everything she does is 100% self-motivated. The people-pleasing is all about improving her standing, influence, or self-satisfaction. She is devoid of altruistic or charitable feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>She is by no means of a logical disposition, and so cannot be considered “calculating” with her actions. Rather than planning and manipulating, she more or less intuits how best to modify herself to maximize her public esteem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the targets of her attention and service are carefully selected based on the degree to which she thinks they can elevate her. Once she decided that Zack was her best shot, she spent very little time or energy trying to please anyone else.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="_jason">Jason</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_name_3">Name</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Haven&#8217;t settled on a name yet. The character is vaguely derived from a "Jason" from the original story so I&#8217;ll go with that for now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_overview_5">Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He is one of 120 Old-Testament-style “Judges” in the same civilization as Zack and Eve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He is 823 years old</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He is the oldest and most revered of the Judges. The miraculous signs he has performed are some of the most famous to date, and many of his written works are considered scripture by some theological schools. (As in our world, canonization is a slow process and settles over time).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_history_4">History</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jason has only officially held the office for about 200 years, but ever since his adolescence (50s) he has been considered a prophet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The early days of his spiritual journey were marked by a vow of celibacy and intense asceticism. There are many monastic orders, but he was called to a more solitary existence. For most of the year, he would survive alone in the wilderness, praying and fasting and writing down his visions and insights. Once every new moon he would come to the capital city and preach, also sharing his written works (some of which were epistles, some poetry, and nearly all of them copied and published right away.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People often tried to follow him back into the wilderness, but he was always spirited away and could never be found. Still, he had many imitators and rivals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took a long time before he was appointed to be a Judge. (Too long, according to his fans and devotees). He never sought the office, and actually took it grudgingly at first, but soon came to find joy in his new form of ministry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Judges here are a more developed and established version of our Old Testament Judges, with a more formally defined office that centers around mediating between the city states. The office of Judge also somewhat resembles that of the Roman censor, insofar as they have the right to expel government officials for immoral behavior. They also have veto powers over local legislation if it is deemed to be morally compromised.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be noted that the aforementioned roles and powers are highly regionalized, and not consistent across the realm. The above pattern is common, but their authority derives entirely from historical contingencies and legal precedents. The culture is diverse from region to region, and the customs surrounding the Judges vary. That said, any Judge is automatically given deferential treatment in any region, and their office is universally honored at least in form if not in substance. For example, if a Judge was travelling to another jurisdiction and pronounced a judgement that would be accepted without question in his own jurisdiction, the local officials would at least formally accept his decision, even if they don&#8217;t intend to actually implement it. They would probably later oficially excuse themselves based on "unforeseen circumstances" or otherwise write up an elaborate loophole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 120 Judges are on paper considered to have the highest official administrative power, but it would be an overstatement to say that they “rule” their regions. The real power his held by various local magistrates and oligarchs, along with wealthy family-syndicates. The Judges realistically only hold sway insofar as the public’s admiration of them allows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are theocratically appointed, using ritualistic processes of divination that vary per region. Their appointment is usually heavily influenced by the priesthood, and must be confirmed by the chief pontiff. (Although if a pontiff rejects a candidate for any remotely questionable reason, it has historically been seen as an overstepping of his customary bounds and is tolerated only grumblingly by the people.) As in Jason’s case, they often double as prophets, some of whom are on par with prophets like our Elijah (along with the commensurate miraculous signs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Judges have been generally well-esteemed until about a year ago, when public opinion began to shift in favor of a unified monarchy (with Zack and Eve as the intended King and Queen.) There has always been ambiguity in the authority structure of the Judges, but recently there have also been suspicions of some Judges being falsely appointed, having allegedly paid off certain key clergy to gain the office.</p>

<p>This is integral to her eventual success at tracking down the B-Team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She is completely dissatisfied with “real” life, hence the Isekai fixation. This isn&#8217;t tied to any particular incident, but she is admittedly unhappy with her family&#8217;s dysfunction and perpetual teetering on the brink of poverty. She also can&#8217;t find any men who fit her standards in this world, (or at least that&#8217;s her excuse for never quite locking down a date.) But there&#8217;s an even simpler explanation for her longing for other worlds: it started as plain old chuunibyou, and her uniquely obsessive personality just latched on really hard and didn&#8217;t let go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The B-Team and their world is only the first part of how we see this fixation play out in a practical way. When she finds out about her angel, and the vastness of the spiritual realm, she almost completely neglects everything mundane (including her family, and even the B-Team itself eventually). Unfortunately, this does not mean she becomes fixated on God himself, but rather merely the “otherness” of the fullness of his creation.</p>
