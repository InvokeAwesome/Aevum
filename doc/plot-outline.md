## Chapter 1
Story opens with a <normal?> day with Grace. We learn enough about her to understand where she is in life, and especially her obsession with isekai.

Near the end of the first chapter, she's lying in bed and starts to think about life. She's mulling over her recent acceptance of the reality that the world is inescapably mundane. This emotional pendulum is swinging so far from its previous state that she even questions her faith... God seems to be yet another fanciful notion invented by people who couldn't accept the finality of death. The narrative gets increasingly abstract for the span of several stanzas, and the chapter ends with unresolved questions and some oddly out-of-place word pictures.

## Chapter 2 (adapted from notes)
The language in this chapter is substantially more elevated than the previous or subsequent chapters.

Grace is having an out of body experience. She sees her own spirit coursing through the time scape. She looks up and sees a tether to what she senses is also her spirit looming over her, controlling her like a puppet. She then, further out of body, sees herself in this situation as a glittering string of time states all at once. Then the strings unwind into a billion strands so small as to be indistinguishable. These stretch on ahead in many directions, coalescing into a crystalline ocean of possibilities, with waves that break against massive, impenetrable voids. She looks up to see a winged woman staring at her in this undulating space... the woman is not her, but sometimes she looks just like her for a split second. 

The woman's gaze shifts to something behind her. Grace turns and sees darkness and horror enveloping her, slashing and clawing and grasping for her with a thousand deformed hands. She tries to move away, but can't feel her legs. She tries to scream but can't make a sound. The only thing she can coherently remember about her life before this awful fear is a prayer her mother would say to her at bed time, when she was little. She tries to say the prayer, but can only mouth the words with great difficulty.

Soon, as though sensing a predator approaching, the darkness hesitates, and then reluctantly retreats. A pale, and then blinding light appears, and a fiery, glowing hand lifts her up. A man's voice says "don't be afraid." Her eyes, up until now being shut tightly with fear, and now because of the light, begin to open as the light moves away and inhabits a distant place, behind the crystal ocean. 

The winged woman is seen standing up and removing her wings from covering her own head, and standing up from a prostrate bowing posture, facing where the light came from. There seems to be a floor now, or at least Grace feels that "up" and "down" are meaningful again. A ripple in the sea is seen from a different direction, and a lesser but still brilliant light approaches. The winged woman again shields her face, but with only one wing. She bows, but does not prostrate herself. Grace squints. 

This new angel, appearing as an amorphous, fiery entity, looks at the winged woman and asks a question in an unintelligible language. She points in the direction that the demon retreated. The second angel looks in that direction, then turns to Grace as if he just noticed her. As he turns her direction, his appearance shifts to become humanoid, and then fully human. 

He stretches forth his hand at her. Grace begins to fall at startling speeds. Earth and specifically her house and bedroom are beneath and she hurtles toward her sleeping body. 

She wakes up screaming, in a cold sweat. She does not calm down for some time. She eventually begins to pray silently, her lips moving to the words of that same bedtime prayer, and she calms down. With her mind still trembling from the intensity and otherness of the experience, she gets up and turns on a lamp at her desk, but not before stumbling over some books on the floor. 

She opens her laptop, and logs in, failing at the password five times, because her hands are shaking and her fingers are stiff. She closes an open browser, opens a word editor, and writes down everything that happened. Though she struggles to find words to describe it, she remembers everything clearly. She spends a lot of time in prayer that night and doesn't fall back to sleep until two hours before she has to get up for school. 

## Chapter 3

That day she falls asleep in class and has a really goofy dream that her childhood superheroes appeared and scooped her up, just like she'd always wanted. The classmate next to her elbows her and she wakes up. The classmate tells her to look at what's on the screen of the laptop of the guy sitting in front of them. Dozens of other classmates, and even the professor, are gathered around, watching. The audio from her dream had actually been the news report on the laptop. 

It tells about the sudden, inexplicable appearance of strangely-dressed people, one of them armed, who have caused great public alarm and thusfar avoided capture by using impossible abilities. There is an old man, a middle-aged man, and a young woman, and they appeared in a blinding flash of light in the middle of an intersection in <Melbourne, Australia?>.

The woman is dressed in something like armor, although it looks like it's something straight out of a science fiction game. She has what is unmistakably a futuristic assault weapon, and has used it to unleash a destructive power unthinkable for a weapon its size. She seems to not have intentionally killed anyone yet, but has destroyed roads and walls as they've made their escape from the SWAT teams sent to apprehend them. Bullets have been seen to deflect around her by virtue of a strange, barely-visible polygonal shape that surrounds her and moves with her. She can leap several stories at once and run at incredible speeds.

The younger man is dressed in ornate robes, possibly religious in character. He is also seemingly protected from projectiles by another invisible shield. He does not have any weapons, nor does he have any special abilities. The woman shields him scrupulously, and carries him when she needs to leap or run quickly.

The old man wears very plain, uncomfortable-looking clothing. Aside from his well-trimmed beard, he seems almost like a beggar from a third-world country. The woman does not seem concerned with protecting him, yet he somehow consistently evades capture. Well, actually, he *has* been captured several times, because he never puts up any resistance. But each time, shortly after being detained, he disappears, sometimes reappearing with the other two. He has even been caught on camera simply opening the door of the police cruiser and just walking out, the handcuffs simply falling off, and no one seeming to notice him.

After watching for a bit and finally being convinced that it was all real, she bolts out of class and heads home. She begins to pack for her journey to find these people, because there is no doubt in her mind that these are the heroes she has always dreamed about.
