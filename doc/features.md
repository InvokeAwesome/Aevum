## Style
(Most of?) the book will be written in iambic hexameter couplets, also known as
"heroic couplets." This takes after the style of Alexander Pope (translating
Homer) and John Dryden (translating Virgil). My goal is to resurrect classical
epic poetry for our current cultural milieu, in a way that is aesthetically
pleasing and accessible enough for the mainstream.

This is not just a gimmick, I hope, but serves a more immediate purpose for the
narrative. The portions in verse are written from a heavenly, angelic
perspective (see below), and the poetic format is intended to evoke that
transcendence.

I should be able to achieve an earthly counterpoint to this by dropping into
prose when the perspective shifts to that of a mortal human. Hopefully this will
be evocative enough to reinforce the other narrative goals of the text.

## Perspective
The portions of the book that are written in verse, are from perspective of
Grace's guardian angel. We get a very intimate third-person view of Grace, with
impossible levels of detail. The angel can see things as minute as Grace's heart
rate, body temperature, and the subtlest body language. We also sometimes have
"educated guessing" about what she's thinking.

I think it may be important to make sure that we don't ever use definitive
statements about what she's thinking, though. I don't think we want an
unreliable narrator.

When this story was going to be told in game format, I had the player thinking
that they were actually playing as Grace, but then turn the tables when it's
revealed that the player is actually her angel that has been guiding her. The
twist is meaningful because the angel doesn't even realize it is a separate
entity until that point.

In book format, though, I think we should still use third-person pronouns for
Grace. Doing otherwise might seem *too* jarring, and make the narrator
unreliable.

## Medium

The primary source material will continue to be hosted in a git repository.
There are a couple of reasons for this:

1. Change management is good for any complex, text-based work
1. Every time I push changes, it notifies the Discord channel. Commits can be
   viewed and commented on individually as well in GitHub, so collaborators and
   advisors can keep up with my progress.
1. All changes are preserved forever in a historical format. This enables
   interesting textual archaeology.
1. It allows for branching different versions of the text. This is nice for
   trying things out while developing the text, but also enables in a unique way
   a branching "multiverse" narrative. You can have multiple timelines exist in
   multiple branches in git. After the audience finishes reading the primary
   branch, they can use a diff comparison against other branches to see how they
   differ.
1. It also powerfully enables collaboration. People can leave feedback via
   GitHub issues, which can be linked to actual text changes, and can also have
   "pull requests" attached to them where people can propose changes themselves.
   If anyone has an interest in doing so, they could wind up contributing a
   substantial amount to the end product.
1. Related to the above two points, there is the interesting fact that the
   GitHub collaboration model relies on "forking" (making a copy of) the
   repository. Anyone can fork the book and make their own edits to their own
   copy, essentially creating a new timeline in the multiverse. (I would
   maintain a list of canonical timelines, pointing to different forks that I
   believed were believable and worthy to be officially recognized.)
   
When complete, I will publish the book in print, ebook, and audiobook formats
commercially. But the source text will always be available in a publicly-hosted
git repository. The advantage of buying the story (when you could just read it
here for free) would be a more pleasant reading experience.
