## Perspective
Most of the book, which is written in verse, is from perspective of Grace's
guardian angel. We get a very intimate third-person view of Grace, with
impossible levels of detail. The angel can see things as minute as Grace's heart
rate, body temperature, and the subtlest body language. We also sometimes have
"educated guessing" about what she's thinking.

I think it may be important to make sure that we don't ever use definitive
statements about what she's thinking, though. I don't think we want an
unreliable narrator.

When this story was going to be told as a game, I had the player thinking that
they were actually playing as Grace, but then turn the tables when it's revealed
that the player is actually her angel that has been guiding her. The twist is
meaningful because the angel doesn't even realize it is a separate entity until
that point.

In book format, though, I think we should still use third-person pronouns for
Grace. Doing otherwise might seem *too* jarring, and make the narrator
unreliable.
