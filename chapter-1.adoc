Behold the trav'ller wander paths ordained:
Predestined ways she treads, yet unconstrained.
Now left, now right; volition turns her course;
Thus owns the fault in bitter ends' remorse.
Yet turn she here or there, or death forestall,
Whiche'er her chosen road, whate'er befall,
For good or evil, fate decrees the ends of all.

Upon autumnal mountainside, she strides:
A woman fair her foll'wing children guides.
Past fiery oak and golden ash they go,
Along a rivulet's refulgent flow.
Her son, a boy of eight, with glasses thin;
In fraying shoes, and socks that cling the shin;
With breath laborious heaves the limpid air.
She turns, and smiling, deigns to tarry there.
With sinuous grace she bends, with arching back
And silently lets fall her weighty pack.
The boy hurls off his own, with clatt'ring sound,
And sinks, a sweating heap upon the ground
