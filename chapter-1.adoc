Behold the trav'ller wand'ring paths ordained:
predestined ways she treads, yet unconstrained.
Now left, now right; volition sets her course;
thus owns the fault in bitter ends' remorse.
Yet turn she here or there, or death forestall,
whiche'er her chosen road, whate'er befall,
for good or evil, fate decrees the ends of all.

Upon autumnal mountainside, she strides:
a woman fair her foll'wing children guides.
Past fiery oak and golden ash they go,
along a rivulet's refulgent flow.
Her son, a boy of eight, with glasses thin,
in fraying shoes with socks that cling the shin,
with breath laborious calls his mother near.
